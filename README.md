MGolf - Android Development

An Android app around the game of miniature golf including 
- map search of minigolf courts,
- weather forcasts for these places, 
- tracking of teammates and their points,
- game history
- and a training game with physical calculation of the ball movement.

This app was designed to experiment with various Android features such as:
- activities and layouts
- actions and intents
- data providers and event receivers
- asynchronous tasks and background services
- built-in motion and orientation sensors

The core of this app was developed at the GFU Cologne as part of of the seminar 
"Android Introduction: Basics for Java developers" in April 2017.
